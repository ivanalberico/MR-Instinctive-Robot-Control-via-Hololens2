# interbotix_hand_joy

A custom rospackage for controlling the wx250s robotic arm with a HoloLens 2 via messages received over TCP. The controller is an adaptation of and uses the same interface with the robot as the joystick controller provided by interbotix: [interbotix xsarm joy](https://github.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_manipulators/tree/main/interbotix_ros_xsarms/examples/interbotix_xsarm_joy).
